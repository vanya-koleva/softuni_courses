# Software Engineering Fundamentals

**Software engineering is not just writing code, but delivering a reliable product through a systematic process on time and on budget.**

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

**Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy → Repeat**

### 1. Planning & Requirement Analysis

- **Goal:** Define the **what**, why, and who of the project. Describe the functionality.

- **Activities:**

    - Gather requirements from stakeholders (clients, users).

    - Feasibility study (technical, economic, legal).

    - **Define scope, resources, timelines, and risks.**

- **Output:** User stories, Requirement Specification Document, Project Plan.

### 2. **Software Architecture and Design**

- The **software (system) architecture** describes the subsystems, their responsibilities and interactions. It describes:
  
  - How the system will be decomposed into modules.
  
  - Responsibilities of each module and their interactions.
  
  - Platforms and technologies, communication protocols.

- The **software design** describes the system design at a lower level - functions of individual modules, classes, etc.

- **Goal:** Plan the **how** — the architecture and specifications.
  
- **Activities:**

  - Create system design documents (UI/UX, database, APIs, modules).

  - Choose technologies, frameworks, and infrastructure.

- **Output:** Software Design Document (SDD) (High-Level & Low-Level Design).

### 3. **Implementation (Coding)**

- **Goal:** Translate design into actual code.

- **Activities:**
  
  - Developers write code following coding standards.
  
  - Testing and debugging.
  
  - Use version control (e.g., Git).
  
  - May involve breaking work into smaller modules/units.

- **Output:** Working software, source code.

### 4. **Testing**

- The process of checking whether the developed software conforms to the requirements.

- **Goal:** Ensure software is bug-free and meets requirements.

- **Activities:**
  
  - Testers execute various tests: unit, integration, system, UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
  
  - Identify and report bugs; developers fix them.
  
  - Track the development process and its quality.

- **Output:** Test Reports, Quality Software ready for release.

### 5. **Deployment**

- **Goal:** Release the software to users.

- **Activities:**
  
  - Deploy to production servers or app stores.
  
  - May use phased rollouts (e.g., beta, canary releases).

- **Output:** Live software available to end-users.

### 6. **Maintenance**

- **Goal:** Keep the software functional and relevant.

- **Activities:**
  
  - Fix bugs discovered post-launch.
  
  - Release updates, patches, and new features.

- **Output:** Improved versions, patches.
